# CoT(2022)
## Arithmetic Reasoning
1. the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021),  
2. the SVAMP dataset of math word problems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021),  
3. the ASDiv dataset of diverse math word problems (Miao et al., 2020),  
4. the AQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and  
5. the MAWPS benchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016).  

## Commonsense Reasoning
1. CSQA: commonsense questions about the world involving complex semantics that often require prior knowledge.  
2. StrategyQA: requires models to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions.  
3. SayCan: involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete set.  

## Symbolic Reasoning
1. Last letter concatenation: concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g., “Amy Brown” → “yn”).
2. Coin fip: answer whether a coin is still heads up after people either flip or don’t flip the coin (e.g., “A coin is heads up. Phoebe flips the coin. Osvaldo does not flip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?” → “no”).
